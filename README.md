# Python--Jobs-and-Salaries-in-Data-Science

## Introduction

In today's digital world, businesses and organizations have a lot of information to deal with, and people who are good at understanding and using that data are crucial for making smart decisions. Therefore, jobs that involve working with data are really important. Whether it's looking at how people behave, making operations work better, or predicting what will happen in the market, roles like data scientists, analysts, and engineers are a big part of making new and competitive ideas happen. These professionals not only turn raw data into useful information but also connect the dots between data and smart decision-making. In this project, we'll take a closer look at the world of data jobs, checking out how much they pay and how popular they are in the United States.

## Dataset Information:

1. **work_year:** This tells us the year when the data was collected. It's important for understanding how salaries change over time.

2. **job_title:** This shows the specific job title, like 'Data Scientist' or 'Data Analyst'. It helps us see how salaries vary across different roles in the data field.

3. **job_category:** This classifies the job into broader categories like 'Data Analysis' or 'Machine Learning' for easier analysis.

4. **salary_currency:** This tells us the currency in which the salary is paid, like USD or EUR. It helps us understand the salary globally.

5. **salary:** This is the annual gross salary in the local currency. It's crucial for comparing salaries directly in different regions.

6. **salary_in_usd:** This is the annual gross salary converted to United States Dollars (USD). It helps us compare salaries globally.

7. **employee_residence:** This is the country where the employee lives. It helps us explore salary differences based on geography and cost of living.

8. **experience_level:** This classifies the employee's professional experience level, like 'Entry-level' or 'Senior'. It shows how experience affects salaries in data-related roles.

9. **employment_type:** This tells us the type of employment, such as 'Full-time' or 'Part-time'. It helps us analyze how different employment arrangements affect salaries.

10. **work_setting:** This describes the work environment, like 'Remote' or 'In-person'. It shows how work settings impact salary levels in the data industry.

11. **company_location:** This is the country where the company is located. It helps us analyze how the company's location affects salary structures.

12. **company_size:** This tells us the size of the employer company, categorized as small (S), medium (M), or large (L). It allows us to analyze how company size influences salaries.

This assessment is crucial for understanding the current salary trends in data-related jobs in the United States. The dataset covers a span of four years, from 2020 to 2023, and includes a total of 8,080 records distributed across these years.

The reported data job categories are as follows:

- Data Architecture and Modeling
- Data Science and Research
- Machine Learning and AI
- Data Engineering
- Data Analysis
- Leadership and Management
- BI and Visualization
- Data Management and Strategy
- Data Quality and Operations
- Cloud and Database

Participants in the dataset reported their experience levels, which are categorized as follows:
- Senior
- Mid-level
- Executive
- Entry-level

## Key Findings

1. **Trend**:
   - Post 2021, Data Science and Research recorded the highest surge in job roles ending 2023 at nearly 2500 roles. Truly complementing why itâ€™s the most in demand sector in IT, closely followed by Data Engineering.

2. **Salary Range**:

   - The highest reported salary in the 4-year period is $450,000.00 for a Mid-level Research Scientist.
   - The lowest reported salary is $24,000.00 for an Entry-level Data Scientist.
   - The median salary is $150,000.00, representing 2.48% of the total reported jobs.

3. **Correlations and Trends:**

   - Salary has a positive correlation with experience level (highest reported at 0.21) and an inverse correlation with work location (lowest reported at -0.046).
   - On average, more experienced employees report higher salaries.
   - Work location has a minimal impact on reported salary.
   - Full-time, in-person employees are the highest paid, followed closely by full-time remote employees.
   - "Machine Learning and AI" is the highest-paying job category for both in-person and remote data professionals.
   - "Data Architecture and Modeling" is most lucrative for hybrid employees.

4. **Data Period Significance:**

   - Approximately 99% of the data is from the most recent period, making it highly significant for analysis.
   - Average salary for full-time employees has remained relatively stable over the last 2 years across work settings and experience levels.
   - Entry-level positions show the most variability in pay recently, with sharp spikes, both positive and negative.
   - Senior-level positions exhibit an overall positive average salary hike, whereas Mid-level positions, along with Executive-level salaries, show a moderate increase in specific working setups.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the current salary landscape of data-related jobs based on US, highlighting the significant interplay between experience levels and work settings.
